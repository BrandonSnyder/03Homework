Just some note to get my brain going. 

Goal randomly generate a password with all or atleast one of the following: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters.



Create check function to verify correct amount of characters
Create check function to verify use of all selected characters


arrays of each
random number selector
for loop to compare arrays
converting string to array for comparisons
pop up with selection of characters. window.prompt()
pop ups asking if the user needs each of the types in the password. window.confirm()


Flow:

Declare global variables
Ask for length
Check input
Create pool of characters to pick from
Pick characters
Verify all selected character catagories are used
output new password to screen
